Tenting. We spend weeks sleeping out in the cold, rain, and mud. We sacrifice sleep, grades, and social life. And we do it all for the chance to squeeze ourselves into a tiny little gym with 1,600 of our classmates and watch ten other students toss a leather ball at a metal hoop.

Is it crazy? Yes. Is it worth it? [Absolutely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNp7_-in2es).

You see, tenting is more than just an activity. It's more than just a game. Tenting is about passion and camaraderie, about dedication and sacrifice, about ritual and tradition. It's more than just a game.
