Das Boot began the 2015 tenting season with renewed enthusiasm. With a handful of members returning from abroad, the team was ready to get back inside Cameron. For the first time in tent history, Das Boot fielded a roster with no freshman, as three seniors and two juniors were added to the already veteran roster.

Instead of going with a commercial tent like nearly all of Kville, Chief Engineering Officer Connor Tinen decided to design a tent from scratch. The skeleton of the structure was based around a commercial canopy, and the tent covered a 10 by 20 foot area right at the front of Kville. Das Boot 3.0 had no shortage of amenities, featuring a couch, interior lighting, insulation, and a white picket fence and mailbox.

2015 was a breakout season for Das Boot. With the departure of the Tentagon, a void was left at the top of Kville; a void quickly filled by Das Boot. Das Boot rapidly ascended to tenting stardom and became the talk of Kville. Boosting a strong social media presence on both [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dasbootkville) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dasbootkville/), Das Boot's reach was far and wide. Indeed, Das Boot's notoriety grew so great ESPN's Stan Verrett and Neil Everett [filmed a live SportsCenter segment from inside Das Boot](https://twitter.com/SportsCenter/status/568195511230046208) before the Carolina game.

Though it was a step backwards from last year, Das Boot still cracked the top 10, snagging Tent #8. In the end, the hard work paid off, as [Duke won a 92-90 overtime thriller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNp7_-in2es) on February 18, 2015.

As it turned out, the instant classic Duke overtime victory was a foreshadowing of greater things to come. On April 6, 2015, seven members of Das Boot cheered on in Indianapolis as Duke captured their 5th National Championship, [defeating Wisconsin 68-63](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOu6bCDiZm4).
