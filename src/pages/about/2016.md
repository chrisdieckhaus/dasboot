With seven returning members, Das Boot was not left with a lot of open space for the 2016 season. In addition, Das Boot wanted to recruit heavily in the Class of 2019, since it had no members of the Class of 2018 for the 2015 season. For the 2016 season, Das Boot recruited 9 freshmen, a number not seen since the days of Das Boot 1.0. Due to the high demand and limited space, an unprecedented decision was made - to expand Das Boot into two tents. Freshman Audrey Ellis assumed the captaincy of Das Boot 2.

Twelve members each in Das Boot 1 and Das Boot 2 brought the total enrollment in Das Boot to 24 members, a total that has only been acheived once in the past. In order to accomodate the record-setting tent size, CEO Tinen designed a revolutionary tent covering nearly 400 square feet. Das Boot 4.0 returns\ed many of its famed ammenities, including interior lighting, flags, a mailbox, and picket fencing. Das Boot hosted many distinguished guests over the course of the tenting season, including [Duke Women's Basketball stars Becca Greenwell and Oderah Chidom](https://www.instagram.com/p/BB_F3yQiMRo/), fan-favorites [Marshall Plumlee and Grayson Allen](https://www.instagram.com/p/BB3UQ8OCMWX/), [Duke Basketball great Nolan Smith](https://www.instagram.com/p/BBsei6ViMQI), and the legendary [Duke University Presidential First Family, Richard and Cynthia Brodhead](https://www.instagram.com/p/BByB8q0CMSX/).

In a shocking underdog move, Das Boot 2 managed to snag a higher spot than the more experienced Das Boot 1; the tents were ranked 6 and 7, respectively. The season ultimately ended in disappointment, though, as Duke fell to UNC 76-72 on March 5, 2016.
